      My passion is creating- I have a great time making new things, and I’d like to make something for you. I’ve always been a visually creative person, from doodling as a child to taking fine arts classes in high school and college. Now I like to feature my art <a class="portfolioLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tommysgirlresin/">online</a> and participate in local craft shows and artist feature pop ups.

      Professionally, I’ve been doing web development for 5 years. Before that, my first attempt at coding (before I even knew what coding was) was customizing my Neopets profile page when I was 10. I’ve worked on solo projects and collaborated on a team to meet a client’s vision and needs. The best  part of a project is watching an idea become a reality. Most of my time has been dedicated to frontend coding, but I have also dabbled in the backend of code managing databases and creating functional APIs.

      At home, I am a classic cat lady with a couple cats that I share with my partner and our lovely house mates in a late 1800’s home in Saint Paul, MN. We enjoy decorating our home with eccentric art, emulating our Maximalist style and paying homage to our pets and nerdy tv interests. On nights out we love to check out the wide variety of events and cool eateries available in the twin cities. Most of the time I prefer to have a cozy movie night or play board games with friends over a shared charcuterie board.
