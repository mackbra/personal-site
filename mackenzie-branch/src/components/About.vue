      As an application developer at T2M Works, I specialize in creating single page applications using Vue.js, a progressive framework for building user interfaces. I have 4.5+ years of professional experience in web development, and I am passionate about delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs and expectations of customers.

      I operate in a Scrum Agile work environment, collaborating with my team and customers from the beginning to the end of a project, including designing, developing, and maintaining the web app. I ensure my code is clean, maintainable, and efficient, and I take the extra steps to make sure the web app is both responsive and accessible to users of all needs. I also track my progress and work using GitHub, and I constantly seek to improve my skills and learn new technologies.
